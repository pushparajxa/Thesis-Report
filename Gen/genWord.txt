However,  the  default  isolation  level  of  NDB  is   read  committed,  which  allows   the  results   of
write  operations   in  transactions   to  be  exposed  to  read  operations   in  different  concurrent
transactions.  This   means   that  a  relatively   long  running  read  transaction  could  read  two
different  versions   of  data  within  the  same  transaction,  known  as  a fuzzy  read, or it could get
different  sets   of  results   if the same query  is  issued twice within the same transaction ­ this  is
known as a phantom read.
