\section{Evaluation}

The roll back algorithm mentioned in \ref{alg:ROSSRB} is implemented using a thread pool, where each thread processes given number of table records [100,000]. The implementation is executed at MySql server as well as via directly connecting NDB-Cluster\cite{29} with ClusterJ\cite{clusterj}. 

The results with evaluation at MySql Server are shown below.
